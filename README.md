### Travel Insurance (AI models)
Travel Insurance models are built with both classification and regression technique in machine learning.
The dataset used are available in the folder named Dataset which consist of the hold-out test set and the travel insurance dataset used to build the model.
I have also shared the jupyter notebook as well as the python executable file. The notebook contains all the codes I have used to build the models for the insurance company.

There are two jupyter notebook:
* TravelInsuranceClassification.ipynb - this is where I have used the classification algorithms to predict the insured that are likely to file a claim. 
* TravelInsuranceRegression.ipynb - this is where I have used regression algorithms to predict not only if the insured will file a claim but also the value of the claim.

Incase you run into this error message **"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"**  while trying to load the jupyter notebook from GitHub:
* Please visit "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" and copy the Url link of the jupyter notebook like this 

Packages that are required to import from the sci-kit learn libraries are:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* LogisticRegression
* RandomForest
* SVM
* Decision Tree
* LinearRegression
* PolynomialFeatures
* BayesianRidge
