# Topic Modelling in Text Analytics
As we all know that probabilistic topic models are a class of unsupervised machine learning models which help find the thematic patterns present in data. They have been widely applied to a range of domains from text to images. The basic topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is being depicted by a graphical model in plate notation.

Our goal is to determine the number of topics (k) in a dataset. Similar to the algorithm that determines trends on Twitter. 

The jupyter notebook containing all of the implementation is called **LDA_Dbpedia.ipynb**.

Incase you run into this error message **"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"**  while attempting to launch the jupyter notebook from GitHub:
* Please visit "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" 
* Copy the Url link of my jupyter notebook like this "https://github.com/danladishitu/My_Portfolio/blob/main/TravelInsurance/TravelInsuranceClassification.ipynb" and paste it into the nbviewer search box. Please feel free to download the notebookÂ and use it however you see necessary.

I have provided the link to download the dataset below:
