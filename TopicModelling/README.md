# Topic Modelling in Text Analytics
As we all know that probabilistic topic models are a class of unsupervised machine learning models which help find the thematic patterns present in data. They have been widely applied to a range of domains from text to images. The basic topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is being depicted by a graphical model in plate notation.

Our goal is to determine the number of topics (k) in a dataset. Similar to the algorithm that determines trends on Twitter. 

The jupyter notebook containing all of the implementation is called **TopicModelling.ipynb**.

I have provided the link to download the dataset below:

* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* sklearn.LatentDirichletAllocation
* Nltk
* String
* Re
