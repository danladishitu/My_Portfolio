### Intelligent player scouting and talent acquisition for football managers

**Can clustering algorithm improve the player selection of a team?**

**Can we use machine learning to support team managers in the selection of players for their teams without any form of bias and favouritism from the decision making?**

**This work will investigate the use of clustering techniques to identify possible groupings of players based on a blend of various attributes.**

**Models can then potentially identify patterns that certain players share in ways that would not normally have been considered by the team managers during their manual evaluation. This would help managers diagnose lack of skill diversity, identify under-priced and over-priced players, and potentially influence their transfer decisions.**

**Models should be able to offer recommendation on players based on the manager's preferences.**
